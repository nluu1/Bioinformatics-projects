:open_file_folder: data : contains all the dataset used for projects inside in-R repo

:open_file_folder: [Novice EDA on Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nhiluu/project-2-novice-eda-on-heart-disease-nl/notebook): contains all of my current codes on a published analysis on Kaggle. Some of the packages and libraries are not available on Kaggle (i.e. gt library). Thus, I comprised scripts for the ones I use on R-studio, and the scripts published on Kaggle.
 - :page_with_curl: *EDA-cardio.R* : scrips for used in Rstudio
 - :page_with_curl: *project-2-novice-eda-on-heart-disease-nl.ipynb* : scripts published on Kaggle
