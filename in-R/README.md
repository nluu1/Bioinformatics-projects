## :open_file_folder: Cardio Statistical Analysis
- contains my current scripts that I'm working on in [Blood Work Analysis Repository](https://github.com/PhyloGrok/AnalyzeBloodwork.git) of [Professor Jeffrey Robinson](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeffrey-Robinson-9). This script is frequently updated as I gain more insights/concepts in R
 - :page_with_curl: *LuuCardio.R* : on-going scrips in Rstudio
 - Future updates:
    - Optimize more advanced codes
   - Using ML model to predict diabetic condition based on cardio dataset

## :open_file_folder: [Novice EDA on Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nhiluu/project-2-novice-eda-on-heart-disease-nl/notebook)
- contains all of my current codes on a published analysis on Kaggle. Some of the packages and libraries are not available on Kaggle (i.e. gt library). Thus, I comprised scripts for the ones I use on R-studio, and the scripts published on Kaggle.
 - :page_with_curl: *EDA-cardio.R* : scrips for used in Rstudio
 - :page_with_curl: *project-2-novice-eda-on-heart-disease-nl.ipynb* : scripts published on Kaggle (v1)
   - ***Needs update***

### :open_file_folder: data
- contains all the dataset used for projects inside in-R repo
